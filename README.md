# Foundation_Markups
Marks up a view in Revit with foundation designs taken from a Excel/Python spreadsheet

---

The dynamo script takes an output from the xlwings enabled spreadsheet and creates a markup within a Revit view. Rectangular boxes are created with annotations giving the size, rebar and number of piles (if relevant) within a foundation.
